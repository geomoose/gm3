# GeoMoose Experimental APIs

GeoMoose contains an "experimental" API which is used as a
testing grounds for new improvements. Experimental APIs are meant
to be useful, reasonably vetted, but also subject to change.
The goal is to present new ideas to extend GeoMoose and get real
world feedback before making the API stable into the future.

## addConnectedPlugin

Internally, GeoMoose uses React to render components and Redux
to manage state. `addConnectedPlugin` uses a new style of component
to allow deeper integration with that API. Plugins destined for
`addConnectedPlugin` differ from the previous Plugin definition
since they require the mapping of the GeoMoose state to their props.

Below is a minimal example of the plug-in (saved as `counter.js`):

```
const CounterPlugin = {
    mapStateToProps: function(state) {
        return {
            mapSources: state.mapSources,
        }
    },

    render: function(React) {
        return function(props) {
            return React.createElement('div', {},
                'There are ', Object.keys(props.mapSources).length, ' map sources defined.'
            );
        };
    }
};
```

In `index.html`:

Near the `<script...>` tags:
```
<script type="text/javascript" src="./counter.js"></script>
```

Somewhere in the body:

```
<div id="counter"></div>
```

In `app.js`:

```
    app.experimental.addConnectedPlugin(CounterPlugin, 'counter', {});
```
